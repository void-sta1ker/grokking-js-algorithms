Grokking Algorithms implemented in javascript

## Common run times for algorithms

- O(n) - linear time
- O(log n) - logarithmic (log) time
- O(1) - constant time
- O(n \* log n)
- O(n^2)
- O(n!) - factorial time

## Important

- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations
- Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation
- Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations.
- Big O notation is about the worst-case scenario.

## Solve the logarithmic equation log₂(x) = 3

**Solution By Steps**
_Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equation to an exponential form_
To solve the logarithmic equation \(\log_2(x) = 3\), we need to convert it to an exponential form. The general conversion is:
\[
\log_b(a) = c \implies a = b^c
\]
For our specific equation \(\log_2(x) = 3\), we convert it to:
\[
x = 2^3
\]

_Step 2: Calculate the value of the exponential expression_
Now we calculate \(2^3\):
\[
2^3 = 8
\]

**Final Answer**
\(x = 8\)

**Key Concept**
Logarithmic and Exponential Relationship

**Key Concept Explanation**
A logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. The logarithmic equation \(\log_b(a) = c\) means that the base \(b\) raised to the power of \(c\) gives the number \(a\). This can be rewritten in exponential form as \(a = b^c\). Understanding this relationship allows us to solve logarithmic equations by converting them into exponential equations and vice versa.
