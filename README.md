## Common run times for algorithms

- O(n) - linear time
- O(log n) - logarithmic (log) time
- O(1) - constant time
- O(n \* log n)
- O(n^2)
- O(n!) - factorial time

Example:
n = 8
log(n) = 3
n log(n) = 24
n^2 = 64
n! = 40320

## Big O Notation

- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations
- Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation
- Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations
- Big O notation is about the worst-case scenario

## Arrays and Linked lists

|           | Arrays                                           | Lists                | Hybrid              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Access    | random                                           | sequential           | random + sequential |
| Reads     | O(1)                                             | O(n)                 | O(log n + k)        |
| Insertion | O(n) _except pushing to the end in static array_ | O(1) _head and tail_ | O(log n + 1)        |
| Deletion  | O(n) _except removing the last item_             | O(1) _head and tail_ | O(log n + 1)        |

## Call Stack & Recursion

When using recursion, the items you're looking through is saved on the stack. Computers allocate memory on the stack for each function call

Recursion keeps track of the state

> p. 44 last paragraph where call stack is discussed reminds me of generators & iterators

## Divide & Conquer

1. Figure out a simple case and the base case
2. Figure out how to reduce your problem and get to the base case

## Euclid's algorithm & number theory, inductive proof, traveling salesman problem

## Hash tables: collisions, hash functions, load factor

## Graphs. Graph theory

Breadth-first search solves shortest path problem.
A graph has nodes and edges. A node might have neighbors.
Directed graph - relationship is only one way.
Topological sort - If task A depends on task B, task A shows up later in the list. This is called a topological sort, and it’s a way to make an ordered list out of a graph.

## Solve the logarithmic equation log₂(x) = 3

**Solution By Steps**
_Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equation to an exponential form_
To solve the logarithmic equation \(\log_2(x) = 3\), we need to convert it to an exponential form. The general conversion is:
\[
\log_b(a) = c \implies a = b^c
\]
For our specific equation \(\log_2(x) = 3\), we convert it to:
\[
x = 2^3
\]

_Step 2: Calculate the value of the exponential expression_
Now we calculate \(2^3\):
\[
2^3 = 8
\]

**Final Answer**
\(x = 8\)

**Key Concept**
Logarithmic and Exponential Relationship

**Key Concept Explanation**
A logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. The logarithmic equation \(\log_b(a) = c\) means that the base \(b\) raised to the power of \(c\) gives the number \(a\). This can be rewritten in exponential form as \(a = b^c\). Understanding this relationship allows us to solve logarithmic equations by converting them into exponential equations and vice versa.
